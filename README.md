# AI-Engagement-Data-Analyst-Intern
This repository demonstrates my AI-powered data analysis internship experience, completed under the Excelerate Internship Program in collaboration under "Rochester Institute of Technology (USA)". The 4-week program focused on building practical data science skills to analyze learner engagement and predict student drop-offs using machine learning techniques.

# 📇 Internship Overview
    • Dataset: SLU_Opportunity_Wise_Data.csv
    • Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Excel
    • Platforms: Visual Studio / Google Colab
    • Focus Areas: Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Churn Analysis

# 🗓️ Weekly Tasks Breakdown
    • Week 1: Collected and cleaned datasets, handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed feature engineering to create meaningful new variables.
    • Week 2: Conducted comprehensive EDA with visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover engagement patterns and correlations.
    • Week 3: Built and evaluated machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict student drop-offs and identify key engagement drivers.
    • Week 4: Created a final presentation on the whole internship learning steps.

# 🎯 Outcome
The project successfully delivered a structured, AI-driven analysis pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to predictive modeling — enabling data-backed insights into learner engagement and retention. This internship enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and model interpretation, strengthening both my analytical and technical expertise.
